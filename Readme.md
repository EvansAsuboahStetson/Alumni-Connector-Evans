# Alumni Connector

A student of the Entrepreneurship class has asked four cs students to create an alumni Connector 
Here's what he has to say about his vision for the app:

> Connecting stetson students and alumni can be harder sometimes. Aside linkedIn it is harder to connect students and alumni. So he wants an application where students can filter alumns according to majors or minors or interest. Send them a connection. And finally chat with them. He also wants both students and alumns to be able to post events and stuff happening


-----This is what the cs students have currently  for the entrepreneurship student
